Regarding the influence maximization problem with novelty decay, there 
is an umbiguity in the definition. What is goint to happen when two neigh-
bours are activated in the same time? Who are we going to choose first?



tasks:

1) find a way to interact with a social graph, to get
data from the graph and run an algorithm on it.

When having a big graph, assume for example that there is
a way to access the data of the facebook graph, and we want to
run an algorithm on it.

One test would be to find the minimum distance between two
users, or in a facebook group to find the maximum distance of
this subgraph.

Or get all the connections of a user.
